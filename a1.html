    <h1>Blink Assignment</h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="section" id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <img src="Circuit.jpg" alt="Circuit diagram" />
      <p>
        For this Blink Assignment, I worked with the Arduino and circuit to make three 
        LEDs light on their own! As shown in the image above, this is my final presentation 
        of the layout for the circuit.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Schematic -->
    <div class="section" id="schematic">
      <h2>Schematic</h2>
      <img src="Schematic.jpg" alt="Schematic diagram" />
      <p>
        I decided to draw the schematic diagram to help me visualize what will happen in the circuit. 
        As shown in the image, all LEDs share a common ground and have unique pin numbers as their 
        power sources. The schematic demonstrates the flow of the circuit for each 
        LED: Ground → LED → Resistor → Pin # (13, 12, and 11).
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Calculations -->
    <div class="section" id="calculations">
      <h2>Calculations</h2>
      <img src="Calculations.jpg" alt="Resistor calculations" />
      <p>
        Before starting the circuit,
        I needed to calculate the required resistor value for all three LEDs
        to ensure they would not burn out. Red LEDs typically have a voltage drop
        of 1.8V. Since the supply of the voltage was 3.2V, and the recommended current was 
        0.02A, the resistance was calculated using Ohmn's law: R=V/I=3.2/0.02=160Ω. Based 
        on this, I chose a 220 Ω resistor, as it is the closest standard value to 160 Ω, ensuring
        safe and reliable operation for the LEDs.

    <!-- Code Structure -->
    <div class="section" id="code-structure">
      <h2>Code Structure</h2>
      <p>Here is the code used on the Arduino to successfully light up all LEDs independently:</p>
      <div class="code-snippet">
        // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // turn the LED 1 on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(12, HIGH);  // turn the LED 2 on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(11, HIGH);  // turn the LED 3 on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);             // wait for a second
  
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED 1 off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);   
  digitalWrite(12, LOW);   // turn the LED 2 off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000); 
  digitalWrite(11, LOW);   // turn the LED 3 off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);             // wait for a second
}

    <!-- Additional Questions -->
    <div class="section" id="additional-questions">
      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>

      <div class="question">1. Draw a graph where the X-axis is time, and the 
        Y-axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</div>
      <div class="answer">
        <img src="Graph.png" alt="Voltage vs Time Graph" />
      </div>

      <div class="question">2. How many LEDs could you blink independently 
        with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        As we know, the Arduino Uno has 14 total pins. Each pin 
        can source up to 20 mA, but the total current for the board is 
        limited to 200 mA. This means that only 10 LEDs can be safely controlled at once.
      </div>

      <div class="question">3. How fast do you need to blink your LEDs 
        until you no longer notice they are blinking?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        When I set the delay to 4 milliseconds, it became very 
        difficult to perceive the blinking.
