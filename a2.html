            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <img src="Final%20Fade%20Circuit.jpg" alt="Final Fade Circuit">
            <p>The goal of this assignment was to create a circuit with three LEDs and a 
              push button, ensuring that at least one of the LEDs fades. The image above 
              showcases my completed circuit after successfully achieving this objective.</p>

            <h2>Schematic</h2>
            <img src="Schematic%20Fade.jpg" alt="Schematic of Circuit">
            <p>Before starting my physical circuit, I sketched the schematic showing how 
              the LEDs and push button work. The push button serves as a "gate": it closes 
              when pressed and opens when released. The schematic for the push button is as 
              follows: Ground -> 10k resistor -> pin 2 -> push button -> 5V. The LEDs connect 
              uniquely to different pins: Ground -> LED -> resistor -> Pin # (11, 10, and 9).</p>

            <h2>LED Calculation</h2>
            <img src="Fade%20LED%20Calculations.jpg" alt="LED Calculations">
            <p>I calculated the resistance needed for the LEDs before building the circuit. Red LEDs have a voltage drop of 1.8V. Using Ohm's Law: R = V / I, where V = 3.2V and I = 0.02A, the resistance is 160 Ω. I chose a 220 Ω resistor, as it is the closest standard value.</p>

            <h2>Push Button Calculation</h2>
            <img src="Push%20Button%20Calculation.jpg" alt="Push Button Calculation">
            <p>For the push button, I used a 10k resistor to ensure the current stays at a safe level of 0.5mA, which protects both the microcontroller and the push button. This resistance value is a standard and reliable choice for such circuits.</p>

            <p>Take a look at the code I used to make the circuit function properly!</p>
            <code>
// Setting the pin numbers to the variables.

// buttonPin is connected to Pin 2
int buttonPin = 2;
// ledPinOne is connected to Pin 11
int ledOne = 11;
// ledPinTwo is connected to Pin 10
int ledTwo = 10;
// ledPinThree is connected to Pin 9
int ledThree = 9;

// variable for reading the pushbutton status
int buttonState = 0;

void setup() {
  // Initializing the LED pin 1 as an output
  pinMode(ledOne, OUTPUT);
  // Initializing the LED pin 2 as an output
  pinMode(ledTwo, OUTPUT);
  // Initializing the LED pin 3 as an output
  pinMode(ledThree, OUTPUT);

  // Initializing the button as an input
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);

}

void loop() {
  // Reads the state of the button value
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // Checks if the button is being pressed. If so, the buttonState is HIGH.
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    // Fades in from min to max in increments of 5
    for (int fadeValue = 0; fadeValue <= 255; fadeValue += 5) {
       // sets the value (range from 0 to 255) for LED one, two, and three.
      analogWrite(ledOne, fadeValue);
      analogWrite(ledTwo, fadeValue);
      analogWrite(ledThree, fadeValue);
      // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
      delay(30);
    }
     
  } else {
    // turn LED off when button is not being pressed.

    // led pin one, two, and thee will now be turned off.
    digitalWrite(ledOne, LOW);
    digitalWrite(ledTwo, LOW);
    digitalWrite(ledThree, LOW);
  }

          <h3>Additional Questions:</h3>
          <h4>Question:</h4>
          <p>Draw a chart where the X-axis is time and the Y-axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with <code>analogWrite(led, 64)</code>, <code>analogWrite(led, 128)</code>, and <code>analogWrite(led, 255)</code>.</p>
          <h4>Answer:</h4>
          <img src="Additional%20Question%20fade%201.jpg" alt="Chart showing voltage across LEDs">
          <p>Based on the graph, we find that <code>analogWrite(led, 255)</code> results in a 100% duty cycle (always on), <code>analogWrite(led, 128)</code> results in a 50% duty cycle, and <code>analogWrite(led, 64)</code> results in a 25% duty cycle.</p>

          <h4>Question:</h4>
          <p>Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200mAh battery?</p>
          <h4>Answer:</h4>
          <img src="Additional%20Question%20Fade%202.jpg" alt="Calculation for battery runtime">
          <p>To calculate the runtime, we use the formula shown in the image. With a 1200mAh battery, the total current drawn by the three LEDs (fading) is calculated as <code>(14.5mA × 3) / 2 = 21.75mA</code> Thus, the runtime is <code>1200mAh / 21.75mA = 55.17 hours</code> Therefore, the circuit would run for approximately 55.17 hours when powered by a 1200mAh battery.</p>
