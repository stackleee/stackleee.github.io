            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <img src="A3 Final Circuit.jpg" alt="Final Input Output Circuit">
            <p>The goal of this project is to use a sensor in the voltage divider to change 
                the state of the output device. For this assignment, I used a photoresistor for
                the sensor and a LCD panel to show the output. This image above shows the 
                complete circuit that I did for this assignment.</p>

            <h2>Schematic</h2>
            <img src="A3 Schematic.jpg" alt="Schematic of Circuit">
            <p>Before starting my physical circuit, I would sketch out the schematic with what 
                is happening with the photoresistor, LED, and the LCD Panel. For the schematic for the 
                photoresistor, we see here that the schematic would contain two resistors and a pin in 
                the middle to allow us to use analogRead(). For the LED schematic, it would go from 
                ground to a 220 resistor to LED to pin 9. Lastly, for the LCD Panel, I would show how 
                the LCD Panel would be connected to the Arduino board.

            <h2>LED Calculation</h2>
            <img src="A3 Calculations.jpg" alt="LED Calculations">
            <p>I calculated the resistance needed for the LEDs before building the circuit. 
                Red LEDs have a voltage drop of 1.8V. Using Ohm's Law: R = V / I, where V = 3.2V 
                and I = 0.02A, the resistance is 160 Ω. I chose a 220 Ω resistor, as it is the 
                closest standard value.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Resistors</h2>
            <p> Fo general information you will notice that I used a 220 ohm resistor for the LED. 
                This is because the LED has a voltage drop of 1.8V and a current of 0.02A. Using Ohm's Law, 
                we can calculate the resistance needed for the LED. The resistance is 160 ohms, however, 
                I used a 220 ohm resistor as it is the closest standard value.

                For the resistor for the photoresistor, I used a 10k ohm resistor. This is largely due to
                being safe and make sure that nothing burns out. The resistance value of 10k ohms for the 
                photoresistor is the standard and super reliable.

          <h3>Additional Questions:</h3>
          <h4>Question 1:</h4>
          <p>In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or 
            R2 or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example 
            calculations.</p>
          <h4>Answer:</h4>
          <img src="A3 Additional Question 1.jpg" alt="Voltage Divider Calculation">
          <p>As shown on the image, we see that after using the example calculations
            we can see that the variable resistor cannot be either R1 or R2. We find that 
            when we switch, as you see the final values change significantly when switching
            R1 and R2. Of course, it may vary one what method you do, however, in this case it will not work. 
            Also when switching out the variable resistor to the fixed resistor on the circuit did not allow
            the LED to function properly. Thus, the variable resistor can only be R1.
          </p>

          <h4>Question 2:</h4>
          <p>Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the 
            voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</p>
          <h4>Answer:</h4>
          <img src="A3 Additional Question 2.jpg" alt="Voltage Divider Graph">
          <p>We find here that when the sensor is open and untouched, the voltage is 3.55 V. 
            Meanwhile, when you cover the photoresistor, the voltage value becomes approximately 1.00 V.
            The image above displays the relationship between the voltage and the time for the photoresistor. 
          </p>
          <h4>Question 3:</h4>
          <p>AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 
            10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your 
            map() code? Explain your answer.</p>
          <h4>Answer:</h4>
          <p>When thinking of this question, we would realize that the values of the parameter in the 
            map() function would change. The map() function would be able to handle a larger range of 
            values when changing it to 16 bits. For example, if we had a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter, 
            the range of values would be from 0 to 65535 unlike 0 to 1023. This would change the map() code to 
            be more precise as it would be able to handle a larger range of values. To see the change in the 
            actual code function it would then look like this: int ledBrightness = map(sensorValue, min+5, max-5, 0, 1023);.
